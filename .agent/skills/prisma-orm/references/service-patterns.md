# Prisma service pattern

The shared `lib/prisma.ts` owns the only `PrismaClient` singleton. Import it
only from a Node-runtime, `server-only` module service; do not construct a
client per request, expose it to client components, or import it from
Middleware or Edge runtime code.

Before enabling the service, implement a project-owned current-actor boundary
and authorization policy. Actor IDs are audit data, not authorization: every
read and mutation needs the policy's project-specific owner, role, or tenant
scope. Do not retain an erased `declare` placeholder as a runtime fallback.

Define reusable `select` objects with `satisfies Prisma.<Model>Select`, derive
payload types from them, and map dates, enums, and relations to the module DTO.
Build `where` and ordering from an allow-list, not raw client strings. Use
`$transaction` for a list/count pair and for coupled mutations. Map known
errors such as unique conflicts and missing records to stable service errors;
log unexpected failures without leaking database details.

The widget Prisma service template demonstrates these rules while preserving
the same exports as the mock reference service. Copy it into the module's
canonical service path; do not leave a second active source variant.
